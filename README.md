Assignment for CodeDay Labs Onboarding Activity

Hello! 
I am partcipating in CodeDay labs this summer! I will be working on open-source software that uses machine learning technologies (PyTorch and Tensorflow) to focus on enhancing the technologies in the healthcare industry under the mentorship of Keith Callenburg from Thrive. The goal is to deliver a deployable model of predicting prognosis of renal cancer from whole slides images. I am really excited to be working on this project!
